# Flexbox
## Intro 

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that we can use to create a row or a column axis layout. It makes our life easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use tricky hacks and a lot of float and position properties in our CSS code.

## display-flex

To setting display property you can use `display-{displayValue}`. In this case you can use `display-flex` : Set `display: flex;` for element.

```html
<body class="display-flex ... "></body>
```

Setting flec-wrap by just using

## Flex Direction

You can set `flex-direction` property by using `fd-` type. Here's some value you can use :

`td-row` : `flex-direction: row`

`td-column` : `flex-direction: column`

:::warning[I can't use row-reverse?]

I recommend you to store the value on css variable first, because 2-words value is not supported. Learn more about [2-words value](/docs/extras/all-value#1-two-word-value).

```html title="html"
<div class="fd-[col-rev]">...</div>
```
```css title="css"
:root {
  --row-rev: row-reverse;
  --col-rev: column-reverse;
}
```
